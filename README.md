# next-version: RiC-O v0.2 development branch

The branch where everything thas has to be done for building RiC-O v0.2 will be done.

Other branches, each for one development specific task, will be created, then merged into this one. These branches will be associated with one or many issues.

Once everything necessary is done, the next-version branch will be merged into the master one.

It has been decided that RiC-O v0.2 will have the following features that make it different from RiC-O v0.1:

* it will be compliant with RiC-CM v0.2 full draft, that should be released the same time. In RiC-CM v0.2 full draft, ICA/EGAD has introduced various updates from RiC-CM v0.2 preview:

    ** most of the textual definitions and scope notes of the classes, attributes and relations have been rephrased;
    ** some of the attributes have changed domain and other features (e.g. value schema or specifications)
    ** few relations have been removed, some may still be added
    ** some relations have changed name
    
* its metadata will be more complete, in order to conform to best practices

* each update for any component will be documented

* the introduction will, if EGAD has enough time, include a few diagrams
