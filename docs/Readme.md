May include:

* a short abstract of what RiC-O is, including of course a link to its current official release online)
* the reasons why you should a least consider using RiC and RiC-O (a text adapted from Tobias's email)
* links to the other pages that should also be created in Markdown in the same folder (at least, a page on events and presentations, a page on projects and tools)
* links to the resources that are in the repo (examples and diagrams)
