# Diagrams

This is where you will find some diagrams that show some of the components of RiC-O.

The diagrams may, either display a part of RiC ontology itself, or illustrate how you can represent some real world cases using RiC-O. 

The diagrams are drawn with https://www.draw.io/. Each folder contains the diagram in XML and renditions in JPEG. In RiC language these are two instantiations for each diagram!
