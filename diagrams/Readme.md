# Diagrams

This is where you will find some diagrams that show some of the components of RiC-O. Some of these diagrams may be used for illustrating RiC-O introduction.

The diagrams are drawn with https://www.draw.io/. Each folder contains the diagram in XML an rendered in a PDF and PNG file. In the language of RiC there are three instantiations for each diagram!
