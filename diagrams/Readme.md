# Diagrams

This is where you will find some diagrams that show some of the components of the RiC-O.

In the 'diagrams_v0-1' folder, you will find diagrams using RiC-O v0.1, while the 'diagrams_v0-2' includes diagrams using RiC-O v0.2n the latest version of RiC-O.

The diagrams may, either display a part of RiC ontology itself, or illustrate how you can represent some real world cases using RiC-O. 
The RiC-O v0.1 diagrams coming from the Archives nationales de France have been used for illustrating a presentation on RiC-O done on January 28, 2020 at the Archives nationales de France. The  [slides that were used](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_2_RecordsInContexts_englishVersionAdded1003.pdf), and are in French and English, provide more information of what the diagrams display.

They have been drawn with [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). Each folder contains the diagram in XML and renditions in JPEG. In RiC language these are two instantiations for each diagram!
