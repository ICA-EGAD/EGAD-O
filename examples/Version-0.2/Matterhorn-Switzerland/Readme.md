# Example for converting a METS-based Information Package

This example is based on a simple Matterhorn METS Information Package, which has manually been converted to RiC-O. The example shows a possible way to not only convert descriptive metadata, but a whole information package with technical and administrative metadata to a semantic model. Complementary to RiC-O, the Ebucore and Premis-Ontology were used for this purpose.
