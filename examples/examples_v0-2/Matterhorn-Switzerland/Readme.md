This example is based on a simple Matterhorn METS Information Package, which has been converted to Matterhorn RDF, based on RiC-O, PREMIS and Ebucore. The example shows a way to not only convert descriptive metadata, but a whole information package with technical and administrative metadata to a semantic model. Matterhorn RDF is a data model for digital preservation that covers the whole OAIS information model and it can for example be used with the Fedora 6 repository: https://duraspace.org/fedora/.
